# SimplyLunar
A Garmin Connect IQ widget that shows the current Lunar azimuth, elevation, phase, illumination and age.

Use Select to refresh the widget. 
Use the Menu button to switch between the two display modes.

The azimuth and elevation calculation is based on PHP code by Dubravko Loborec, http://www.dubravkoloborec.com, which was in turn based on the Matlab code by Darin Koblick (See below) (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1284781-darin-koblick)

I found many different lunar phase codes & websites which all give slightly different results! Mine is mainly based on mooncalc.c by John Walker (http://www.fourmilab.ch)

Icons made by srip (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/srip) from Flaticon.

Thank you Peter Bleakley and Holger Haug for suggestions and for helping me to test the widget.
